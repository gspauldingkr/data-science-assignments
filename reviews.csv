"I can't get the damn thing connected. I entered the wrong wifi password initially and now it will not let me correct my mistake. I tried starting over, but it refuses to forget my original password error. It tells me to exit the set up and start again. I thought I did exit. Why the hell won't it let me start fresh?"
"REALLY DISAPPOINTED!! We had purchased a 1st gen Echo earlier in the year. Overall was really happy with it and felt it lived up to hype. And it was on sale, so that was a bonus. So when the 2nd gen came out and it was on sale & with payment plan, we thought ""Great - we'll have one for upstairs and one for down"".The only pro - it has an audio output jack so you can hook directly to a speaker.2nd Gen is horrible. The sound is worse than the 1st gen. It rarely understands our requests. It rarely ever hears our requests. We have to repeat requests almost every time. The sound is horrible, muffled to a certain degree. The volume is nothing compared to the 1st gen. Everything we liked about the 1st gen Echo doesn't happen with this 2nd gen.If I could return it for a 1st gen I would. Get a DOT instead. Or the one of the other product or Google Home.I can't think the last time I completely and wholeheartedly regretted a purchase. I hate this 2nd Gen product. Biggest waste of money. Cannot recommend it at all.DON'T BUY IT."
"Pros: first alexa can hear me from a reasonable great distance.Second Some of the learned skills are awesome! like sleeping sounds and trivia games. Too cool üëåCons: First I could not and cannot get it to work with my Phillips hue bulbs. Everything works great until i ask Alexa to turn on or off my lights. Her response is the same..‚Äùi‚Äôm There‚Äôs multiple items fit that description. Which one would you like?‚Äù To wit we go back and forth until she gives up and powers down. After now 4.5hrs and counting of changing the title of rooms, the bulbs, deleting and re-downloading apps, I‚Äôve gone back to asking Siri to do it. Works every time.Second it doesn‚Äôt work with Apple Music nor Spotify‚Äôs free streaming service. So to play even one song you MUST have a pay-for-subscription to a second tier music provider (I.e. amazon music or Spotify)Third - and I know many people have said it before - The sound is less than extrodinary. Still Not that bad considering it‚Äôs many capabilities that go far beyond beyond emitting quality sound.Sorry amazon. I had high hopes and plannned to incorporate smart hubs for my television and in nearly EVERY room. However I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll be waiting for apples Home pod before I go any further with this"
"I've found that this isn't very useful unless you have paid subscriptions like Spotify or Amazon Music Unlimited (no, that isn't included with Prime)...same with other Echo functions. For instance, nearly every time I tell the device to play a song or artists, I hear a ""sample"" followed by instructions on how to sign up for Amazon Music. I thought the Echo would be a convenient way to listen to music, audio-books, news, podcasts, etc., but to actually use those functions, there are various additional costs, subscriptions, and other setup requirements."
"Disappointed after waiting for release.  The jack to my exterior speakers (which works perfectly on my Echo Dot) does not work.  Very little room for speaker jack from speakers and it wouldn't go in straight.  Having to use speakers because sound output from new gen2 echo isnt great.  Between this new realease that touts better sound and the new Fire TV upgrade, which is just a fancier Fire TV STICK, not a true upgard of the Fire TV, I feel amazon is shortchanging us...I believed both new releases would be better but they are not.  Get with it Amazon, we are smart and demanding customers."
"I received this for Christmas. I absolutely loved it for three days, then for no apparent reason, it lost its connection to WiFi. I have spent hours, trying everything  Amazon suggested. In desperation I called the customer help number. The tech I spoke to was very nice, but I the end she had me repeat the same things I had tried already, with the same result. Now I am supposed to contact my internet provider and have them check out some settings on my modem and router. WTF?  And she was unable to explain to me why it worked fine for three days. Since I received it as a gift, I can‚Äôt even return it."
"Way too much bass when playing music.. It causes the vocals to be drowned out. It causes the vocals to be difficult to discern from the surrounding thump thump thump of the bass. Believe it or not, Amazon, but not every person wants to listen to a pounding bass. I have the Echo Dot and I much prefer to listen to music with the Dot than with this full-size Echo.And it's hard to believe, but there is no way to adjust the bass or treble. Heck, my inexpensive Sears stereo from the 1970's had adjustable bass and treble!!! I am very disappointed by this full-size Echo."
"While using the Echo to play audible books the Echo stopped working then would only play 2 words then quit. After contacting support i was told that he guessed the memory cache was full. My question is why and how did it fill and why is the memory cache not releasing no longer used memory? the answer i received was I don't know. I couldn't get a guarantee that it wouldn't happen again. I'm now returning this for a refurbished Gen 1 Echo. I've never had to go backwards in the world of technology in my life. Amazon, this product is an obvious money grab you should be ashamed. End users, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.***Update***After using the product and comparing it to the generation 1 version and the Google Home. I would have to say that this 2nd generation is a downgrade and not really worth it. I don't know if it's still learning speach but it has serious issues when telling it to play music or audio books. Even when telling Alexa to turn off certain Hue lights she will occasionally tell me that the room i specified doesn't exist and she repeats the room name, i will then follow up with the exact same command and it works. The sound is no where near what the Gen 1 was capable of.  The only advantage i would give it over the 1st gen, thats no longer available, is changable covers. If  you looking for Alexa and a decent speaker, this is not it. It may cost a bit more but an Echo Dot connected to your speaker of choice would be a better idea. This part is specifically for Amazon to address if they can or will. What exactly was upgraded from Gen 1 to 2? The mic's don't work as well and the sound quality is awful. What was upgraded?  -  Almost forgot, i called support for 30 minutes thinking the woofer was not functioning. FYI there is NO diagnostic tool of any kind to tell if the mics and speakers are working correctly, you just have to assume."
"This product is a disaster. If you are considering using one to help run a SmartHome, remember Hal the Computer. If you are too young to remember Hal the Computer, watch the movie ‚Äú2001.‚Äù It‚Äôs a great movie. Hal is the spaceship computer who started killing the astronauts.This echo/Alexa began stopping music midsong for no reason. Sometimes a simple ‚Äúresume music‚Äù was enough to get it going again, but increasingly I had to start from scratch with instructions about which music and which streaming service to play. But before things got bad I ordered a second echo to have the same music in two rooms. Echo1 became more and more contrarian. One unhappy night after I had gone to bed, Alexa started spontaneously playing music. Four different times. Then in the morning, Alexa awakened me with an alarm that I did not set. I double checked on the Alexa app, which keeps track of commands, and it showed no commands from me. When I asked Alexa what was wrong she said go to the Alexa app and give feedback there. So I did. Twice. I explained what was happening. Each time I got an acknowledgement saying that Echo or Amazon or whoever would run diagnostics and quickly respond to me. I never heard back from the Echo support. I went to the Amazon customer service site and sent a complaint via the comments link. Its instructions have not been particularly helpful thus far.Just now, I told Alexa to stop the music. It didn‚Äôt. I made the command again. Music paused and resumed playing. And this happened again and again and again. I had to unplug the device to stop the music. Which means all the programming is gone.If this is how Alexa does with music and alarms, imagine what will happen if you put a voice-controlled lock on your door that Alexa controls. Or burglar alarm. Or HVAC. Or any other of the many devices Alexa is supposed to provide a command channel for."
"Seriously, Amazon... the audio on this new Echo took a turn for the worse. I‚Äôm not quite sure how Amazon could claim the audio has improved when there are substantial shortcomings with the sound quality produced.The audio engineering team needs to give this serious attention and roll out an EQ update soon before the product reputation worsens. Sadly, Amazon is needing to rely on heavy EQing to attempt to make a speaker artificially sound good when they should have relied more on acoustic design.***Update***Amazon contacted me and they are currently working on improving the audio experience through a firmware update that alters the EQ. The EQ edit essentially drops the mid frequencies and possibly some of the high-end frequencies too.  Still, without a bass reflux system we saw in the 1st gen, I don‚Äôt know how much better the bass response can get.I really wish Amazon would have invested more into the audio quality. I suppose when you to cut too many corners to maximize net profits and keep the price under the $100 mark, you wind up producing a sub-par speaker that people disappointingly want to return."
"I bought the 3-pack deal and this review applies to all three. Most reviews complain about the sound quality but I didn't notice that so much.- Lack of responseWhat bothered me the most was the unresponsiveness. The wake word works great, even at a whisper it will start listening, but it very frequently doesn't hear the command and just keeps listening and listening... and listening. My 1st gen would stop listening pretty quick if it doesn't hear anything or respond with ""I don't understand"" or something, the 2nd gen seems to listen forever and doesn't respond to even yelling at it. The times that it does respond, answers are often cut off: ""Alexa, what's the speed of light?"" - ""Light's top speed is 299 mil"" with a little static noise as it cuts out.- Lowest spoken volume is too loudThe second annoyance is that the ""level 1"" volume is much louder than the 1st gen ""level 1"". With the 1st gen I usually kept it around 3 or 4 when listening to music and 2 when I'm working and want some background music, but with the 2nd gen, I usually have it on 1 or 2 and have to get up and press the volume down button to get a quieter volume.Also, when I have it on 1 and my sister ""drops in"" on me, the music resumes at level 3 afterward instead of going back to 1.- GlitchyThere are also other occasional glitches, like one time my sister dropped in and the volume did ""not"" go up for the conversation, also sometimes the music volume doesn't go down when the Echo is listening.- Alarm doesn't workI set two daily morning alarms and they both have failed to ring! I checked the settings multiple times.I'm very happy with the 1st gen, it misunderstands me less than 10% of the time but it does or says something. Not being heard over 50% of the time with the 2nd gen is too much to take. I tested all three and reset one of them twice with no change."
"After having four of these connected in the past six months or so, I think I can safely say - they SUCK.I have had intermittent problems with one of the units - interestingly, the one nearest my wifi router, less than 20 feet away. Since I plugged it in, it has repeatedly disconnected from my network for hours at a time, but will eventually reconnect - meaning, it can't be relied upon to be an alarm clock or a reminder device. This morning, I decided to wipe all of the units clean, purge ALL info at Amazon regarding them, and start over again from scratch. Besides these four units, I have had 5 other Echo devices since they came out, so I have a pretty good idea how this process works. Have been on the phone with Amazon 'support' - ha ha - and they can only do BASIC network troubleshooting 101. A 7 year old knows more than they do.I have finally decided ENOUGH. I'm selling these things on EBAY, and going back to Google devices!"
So so disappointed. I hate the echo to begin with but my daughter and son love it for their rooms.  I thought this would be a nice surprise but the sounds is on par with the echo dot.  What exactly is better in the second generation amazon?????
"Really can't find a use of this device without incurring the cost of various monthly services, ie music services, cloud storage services, or buying home automation devices, etc. It sits unplugged on a table supporting a thermometer that has a broken easel support. Ads should make it clear it does very little without buying something else. For example, it will not "" Alexa, play a song by the Beatles"" unless you have a Beatles playlist stored in the cloud or subscribe to Amazon's music service."
Like everyone else I must agree the sound is lacking it does get loud but full range sound not close .. If you put against the corner of a room against the wall maybe it resonates for some bass but... why would. you take a step back and also advertise better sound it has almost same drivers from the gen 1 version ..? I am hoping this gets fixed from so many poor reviews of this speaker... I also sold mine and my tap that by the way does sound less then gen 2 echo so i guess good job on that..?... Aaaaahhhhhh... S99... COME ON GUY...
"This is such a disappointment I don't where to begin.  First I had planned to use this device as a stand alone to play music, specifically numerous playlist I have created over the years of music collection.  After uploading a couple different playlist, I reached the limit of allowable upload, almost.  But then without notice Amazon ended that service and plans to permanently discontinue it, deleting the playlist and time invested.  As it is Alexa struggle to play my music playlist, her hearing suffers.  I have renamed them, but she still regularly stumbles.  If I want to play MY music I have to bluetooth my IPOD.The next thing I discovered was the linking up smart home devices has not been as easy as I was led to believe and in some case never worked.  I have really come to dislike this device as a result of hours wasted trying to achieve seemingly easy task.  I am looking into other options now as I do not find the convenience of this overpriced dumb speaker worthy of continued disappointment.  As to the point of its sound... not bad.  So maybe that's worth the one star that I have to give it."
"I am very disappointed with this device. Its sound quality is so poor that both my s/o and myself find it difficult to understand the responses and there are so many questions that it cannot answer. Basic questions that Google answered in depth when I asked the same question. Also, I had a terrible time setting this model up to control my TV and my additional media components. Fight now, it will turn the TV on and off, but not much more.I am considering returning this and the second unit that I purchased. Almost worthless when compared with asking Google the same question."
"This 2nd generation is not an improvement! Slow response and the sound is nowhere near as good as the 1st generation. The ""twist"" volume control has been replaced with unlighted buttons which can be a problem in a dark room. The only improvement I've found is the added speaker jack. Buy the dot instead and plug in a quality speaker."
"spend more time repeating myself and resetting items. if you have a few of them the issues will start.note, i have overkill on my internet download speed. averaging over 100 MB download speed.and customer support is non existent  ,,they claim they will get with tech and respond back with help, but it never happens.if you are looking to use several as a group for music forget about it,you will spend your time resetting the items and have issues getting them to all play at one time for a group.i have tried three times and the customer support has simply blown off this issue , have never received help or a response back.BUYER BEWARE!!!!  wasted over $1000.00 on these things outfitting my house with them huge mistake.all worked fine when i only had two devices"
"Does not meet my expectations! I have tried multiple times to set up with music from my phone, and it will not recognize my playlist from my phone, nor does it recognize music my sonos! It does however, recognize amazon music if you are a subscriber. I wish I can return this, I truly don't like it. I'm going to sell it if I can't return it.  Echo is tied in with Amazon library and thats it, and tunein station and anything else you are required to join/subscribe too. Also, my sonos has a better sound than Alexa. :("
"If you're searching for an Alexa enabled speaker to listen to music on look elsewhere. The sound quality on this speaker is a huge letdown and step down from the first generation device. After listening to a couple of songs on Spotify I had it back in it's packaging to be returned. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a portable speaker that was purchased at fraction of the cost of this device sounds more lively.Putting ""improved sound"" in the item title is incredibly misleading. The sound output on this is not at all comparable to the first generation Echo."
"total let down. this is my first ever echo, meaning i didnt have the first gen. but the advertisements seemed so cool, i really wanted to try it out, even bought 2 of them because i was so excited. BIGGEST let down is that i literally have to ask alexa to do or play something 3 to 4 times until she finally even responds. its not that she replies right away and says that she cant do that certain thing i asked like she sometimes does which i understand...its the fact that she doesnt even respond even after being right next to it and asking over 4 times. the concept is cool... but would be better if it wasnt so frustrating to use. considering returning."
Don't waste your time if you have a Chromebook as it does not work.  I spent 2 hours trying to set it up and even called Support who needs access to your wi-fi spent 40 minutes with support and they could not help me.  Very disappointing as it should CLEARLY state this does not with CHROMEBOOK.Contacted what I thought was customer support for Echo and I got hacked ................This product is a huge liability if you care at all about your security for any and all devices.I read a review that Echo 2nd generation by far exceeded sound quality of Bose II speaker so that is why I bought this as I did not think that Bose II speaker was loud enough.  Well the Bose basically connected itself once I gave access to my blue tooth device.
"Not responsive. I am returning it. Amaozn is sending another one. I hope the new one is better. I also have a Dot, it response every time. I sure hope the new one works as well as the dot does. The top lights up like it hears me but nothing happen. If I give it the same command over and over again eventually it will work.  Not what I was hoping for."
"I have an Echo 1st Gen and it is way better than the Echo 2nd Gen I just received. Neither are worth a bleep for music. The 2nd Gen has terrible sound! Shame on Amazon for releasing such a piece of garbage. I‚Äôm returning it.Edited to Add:Another reviewer said s/he got a firmware update to version 592452420 and now their Echo 2nd Gen sounds great. I called and talked to Amazon Customer Service and verified I had the latest firmware, which I do, the one listed above. Perhaps it helped a tiny bit, but the sound from the 2nd Gen is still horrible. Anything over volume 3 and you get a tinny high pitched almost static type of sound and the base just sucks. This device is NO GOOD for music at all, even with the latest firmware. Face facts, firmware can only fix a few minor issues. If the hardware (speakers) are garbage then the sound will be garbage. No firmware is going to fix this issue. Amazon released a subpar device and they don't seem to care. I'm tired of testing it and trying to make it acceptable, I just called Amazon and initiated the return of this garbage. I like Amazon and it's services, but I won't buy anymore of their cheaply made garbage devices."
Just received my 2nd Generation Echo's and not at all happy with the sound quality compared to the 1st Generation.  We have 3 1st Generation Echo's and 5 Dot's throughout the house and love them.  Just unboxed the 2nd Generation and immediately you can tell the clarity and depth of sound is just not there.  I will definitely be keeping my 1st Gen's and returning these.
"I received the all new Echo as a birthday present three days ago, and I was thrilled to be able to listen to my music, podcasts, and audiobooks. But 3 days later, the thing just doesn't work! I connected it to Spotify, and it worked at first. But now when I ask Alexa to play music on Spotify, there is either SILENCE or she says she will resume playing music on Spotify, but then nothing happens. I have the same problem when trying to listen to a podcast. She says she will play it on AnyPod (the podcast app I downloaded from the Skills section), but then nothing happens.Also, the voice recognition is really bad. Even when I speak really slowly, she misunderstands me. No one has ever complained about my pronunciation or my articulation. I think it's pretty good, in fact, but Alexa can't understand most of what I ask her."
"I bought the 3 pack to add to my 8 other Alexa devices. Very disappointed in the sound that was sold as ""improved""."
"After months of use... when it counts... I hate Alexa!  This product feels beta all of the time. Failing when activation word is used, and starting when unasked every single day. I find my myself swearing at the top of my lungs constantly at ""Alexa"" to shut up, repeating what I had stated five times already in a row, or trying to figure out how what I said could possibly have to do with the result I am getting.I made a massive mistake in these purchases. I Smart things hub, Phillips Hue, Security System, etc. Alexa can barely answer weather questions (the worst ever/inaccurate) let alone turn lights on, or turn off the blaring alarm that was tripped accidentally.God, I hate Alexa!"
"Very disappointed in Amazon over the newest generation Echo.  I‚Äôve always been impressed with the quality and thought they put into products, but the sound quality on the new Echo is simply terrible!  Tinny with almost no bass or depth, and they certainly don‚Äôt live up to the description of ‚Äúimproved sound quality‚Äù. Love the look compared to first gen, but that‚Äôs probably not enough to convince me to keep the three units I bought. More than likely, I‚Äôll be returning them and going with something different."
"***EDIT at the end of the original review... ***Second EDIT following that...  ***Third one just now...If you are a seasoned Echo user, don't think that this is going to be an upgrade to your audio desires.The original Echo sounds better.  Period.I miss the volume spin-ring on the top of it, but mostly, I miss the better sound out of the original.  Seems like this one gets louder at full volume, but the sound quality suffers, most likely due to the smaller resonating chamber and lack of a bass port.  Not to mention, they reduced the size of the tweeter.  Should've put that Dolby tech to task on the original design.Pros:  Shorter and less likely to be knocked over.Might be more aesthetically pleasing.Has an ""AUX out"" 3.5mm jack to hook it up to a home system.Cons:  Doesn't sound as well.No volume ring to spin around.No LED to indicate connectivity - white on the original = online, amber = seeking or no connection.Volume up/down buttons are slow to respond, original ring design was much better.If you're new and into the market, look for a ""certified refurbished"" first generation model and you'll get better sound out of it.It's a shame that Amazon advertises this as having better audio than the previous generation.  Just the same as taking away the ring volume adjuster in favor of the up and down buttons, it's obvious that Amazon is really trying to drive their production costs down and sadly, the quality seems to have really suffered with this release.*** EDIT 11-20-17 -Yes, the sound quality has improved after the pushed update to the software came through.Bass is noticeably improved, and as far as I can tell, this one sounds better than my three first-gen Echos now after the update.That being said, it does seem that even though this version advertises better microphone recognition, I find myself having to speak louder to gain it's attention over the first generation.  Quite often.  I wonder if that has to do with the seven pinhole microphone ports on this one versus the countless ones on the top of the original.  Sometimes I have to yell at it just to get it to ""wake"" and recognize a command.  Hopefully, this additional problem will be resolved in an update soon.I am leaving the review at three stars at this point because even though my initial dissatisfaction with the sound quality seems to have been resolved, the more I use it, the more I realize other shortcomings it has.  Hopefully these issues will be resolved and I can revise my review in the future, but for the time being I've been in contact with Amazon and they've extended my return period until after Christmas, and if these issues are not fixed before then, look for my unit listed on their site as a refurbished one.***OK, this thing is really starting to rub me the wrong way.  I lay in bed with this one that I play music on, and these microphones positively suck.  I tell her to send a message, and the original Echo in a bedroom 50 feet away picks it up and cancels this one out, so the message is sent and the recipient thinks I'm sending the message from the bottom of a pool with my lungs full of water.  I'm reducing my initial rating from three stars to a single one because I've gotten so agitated at this device on several occasions that made me want to throw it against the wall.  I haven't been this pissed off at an electronic item in a long time.  It's a shame, every other Amazon device I've been using far exceeded my expectations, and it just seems like this redesigned model was rushed to market too soon and with cheaper materials.*** EDIT 2-22-18 -I have since set up a ""group"" among several Alexa devices, and even with the most recent updates, I still contend that the sound quality is simply better on the original Echo.  I have three of those, so I would like to say that I'm able to tell the difference.  Also compared this second generation Echo with the same audio feed to an Echo Show.  The Show compares much better to the original Echo, but does lack the omni-directional sound projection of either the original Echo and this, the second generation Echo.Microphones seem to have improved, as I have set up both an original and second gen Echo side-by-side, and the newer Echo is the first one to pick up and cancel the older one out."
"UPDATE 11/05/17: I have been working with the Echo Gen 2 for a day with the software update that is supposed to improve the audio quality. I have been testing both Alexa voice and music, and while the software update does slightly improve the audio quality for music, it still sounds very constrained and about as good as a small low end Bluetooth speaker. Audio quality for the Alexa voice is still pretty muddy compared to the Echo Gen 1. I am returning the six Echo Gen 2 devices that I bought and replacing them with Echo Gen 1 devices. I notice that Amazon limits the quality of Echo Gen 1 devices they allow you to buy, so if you are thinking of swapping out Gen 1 for Gen 2, you probably want to buy the Gen 1 devices soon.I feel I gave the Gen 2 device a fair shake, but the hardware and the software are just not of high enough quality compared to the Gen 1 device. It's too bad because I really like the form factor and the fact that you can get different skins for the device. But, my primary use of the Echo devices is for Alexa voice control and response, and I need the voice to be clear, and the Echo Gen 1 (and the Echo Dot Gen 2) provide a crisp, clear Alexa voice. I listen to music on Sonos so the music playback quality of an Echo device is of secondary importance for me.I bought six of these to replace some Echo Dots and one Echo Gen 1. I am planning on returning all six, after having configured and used three of them for a few days. The sound quality of this device is horrible. I use my Echo for home control, flash briefings, dad jokes, etc... and not much for music (I control Sonos with Alexa for music). The Echo Gen 2 has a very muddy sounding Alexa voice, and the music sounds very constrained. I have read that Amazon pushed a software update to select customers to ""fix"" the audio issues but I'm not sure that I'm willing to gamble that this will actually work to improve the sound. Let's see if Amazon reaches out to me and offers me the update in the next few days before I return these. I also don't understand what benefits the Dolby technology gives to the Echo Gen 2, I was expecting tremendously great sound with the Dolby technology but was sorely dissapointed.The package also claims that the microphone array is much improved but in my experience, the Echo Gen 1 units do just fine in all the rooms of my house where I have them.I bought six Echo Gen 1 units to replace the six Echo Gen 2 units that I am considering returning."
"Whoever said this has improved sound over Gen 1 needs a hearing exam. Gen 1 sounds like a similarly sized ""insert expensive speaker"". Gen 2 sounds like a loud phone in a shoebox. I haven't noticed her understanding me better either. Not that I care about that anyway. It's fun yelling at her. I'm sticking with the real Alexa."
"I have the first generation and it beats this one by a mile, which is crazy. I've had nothing but trouble with this one. Sometimes you have to yell to get it to pick up your voice even though you are 2 feet from it. It frequently will not perform skills and when you ask to open a certain skill it will instead ask you if you want to make a call. I've contacted support 3 times and they all say to reset it or unplug it. I can't keep resetting it and unplugging it every single time I want to use it."
"Unhappy. I didn't want to write a review until I spent time with my Dot and 3 Echo towers.  I have had my Echo family for two months now.  While I love the sound, the speakers are just perfect for my room sizes, I am underwhelmed as my Echos are no longer working correctly when I play music on them. They cut out randomly, solo or during multi room play.  I have registered/deregistered; factory reset; deleted and rebuilt every option that was recommended to me in Echo Facebook groups and on the self-help Alexa Device Support pages.  I have contacted Amazon support directly, waiting on a reply.  If you do decide to get the Echo system make sure to get the protection plan. I did not."
"The system's ability to interpret speech is impressive. It's ability to convert text to speech is also very good, though occasionally emphasis on the wrong word produces amusing results. But the implementation of the rest of the system is sadly lacking.The setup is a total frustration. Setting up the unit itself is no problem, but you then have to download and install the smartphone app to control it, and that's where the trouble begins. First, the process to sign in to your Amazon account is a total pain. You have to enter your password twice, who knows why? And if you have created a long complex password with two-factor verification, as Amazon correctly urges for a site that has access to your credit card, it's easy to make a mistake trying to type into a smartphone. And when you do you have to start all over. It took 15 minutes to get the system to accept my log-in.We bought two Echo units with the intent of using them as an intercom. Big mistake! For some unfathomable reason in order to have two units in the same house talk to each other you have to sign up for the Drop-in feature that allows you to call another unit or even a phone anywhere on earth. I guess Amazon never considered the notion that a user would want to use the system as an intercom but not for calling outside the house. And signing up for Drop-in was a total misery. It took hours. The first issue is the Amazon server that does this seems to be totally overloaded - it took 5 to 10 minutes for it to respond with the security code you need to enter. Of course by this time you have pressed ""send again"" several times,so you don't know which code to use. Then it seems to lock out your cell number, but never tells you it did. Instead it gives you a ""can't connect to system"" error message.Finally, after getting that resolved we find it works very poorly as an intercom, at least when the two units are not totally out of hearing of one another. There is a significant delay in transmitting the sounds from one unit to another - maybe half a second. That means you hear directly what the speaker says then a little later hear it from Echo. Makes conversation very difficult. It would probably work well if the two units were totally out of ear-shot of each other, but not if you just want to enhance conversations that are far enough apart to make hearing sometimes difficult.But it got worse, possibly because the two units were not totally isolated from each other, though I read they are supposed to deal with that. They don't. We found that from time to time when we spoke to the nearest unit the light ring would acknowledge our command, but then not otherwise respond to the command. Nothing, time and again. Both units did that, working normally sometimes then failing for a while, then work again. Amazon tech support had no idea of the problem, but sent a new unit promptly. The new unit did the same at first, but after a while both worked normally. I think the solution was I changed the ""wake word"" on one of them so one responds to ""Alexa"" and the other to ""Computer.""So now they work. But to what end? The intercom feature that was high on our list works poorly. She tells really corny jokes. It does work as a timer pretty well. It plays music but is very hard to get it to select what you want unless you want just anything from a specific artist. Who want's that? It tells the time and weather, but responds ""I don't know that"" to most any other question. Siri does much, much better at answering questions. We're not interested in having it control ""smart home"" features, nor using it to communicate with others. We have perfectly fine telephones for that. We'd never use it for voice ordering - we always want to compare alternate products and read the reviews, which you need a screen for.So, it's an expensive timer to remind us to let the cat in from the cold on the screen porch, but little else for our purposes. It might be worth the trouble if you really want to use one of the features we have no need for."
"Purchase the first generation back in 2016 haven't had any issues with that so thought I would buy one for ever room. 3 bedrooms and the living room I have two Echo dots in spare rooms ,the second generation Echo In master( originally had a dot in the master and work perfectly fine )and frist gen. in living room. I can't complain about the dots or the frist generation. The second gen. never understands what I'm saying always have to repeat myself two times to get the command to go. Moved to a different location still having the same issue. Called customer service lady was nice told me she would have to get back to me that was a abouta monthh ago still no call back. So after a week with no response decided it might be faulty returned it and got a new one still having the same issue. Can't be the internet it's only about 10 feet from my modem/router. House is only a ranch not a masion don't have  any issues with any other  connection  and the dots are farther away from the modem. Maybe it me or something but would rather have the frist generation that's more money  or the dots"
"Never got to use it, could not get it to work!  Contacted tech support several times and they kept kicking me up to a higher higher tech who could not get it to work either.  Then I was sent another echo, that one did not work either, so I think its something in my security system that just would not allow alexa to work but will never know, just got tired of trying to get it to work, (several hours was enough).  It was a fun gadget but not worth the time, energy etc... it would take to finally get it to work, (probably could get better tech support, as experts they were nice but recommended things I had already tried but I re-tried them anyway)."
Extremely disappointed with the sound quality. This will be returned and I just ordered the 1st generation echo that sounds a lot richer.
"Amazon promotes 'group play' but has released a software with huge holes in it.  The support people respond quickly but the answers are weak and offer no substantive resolve.  When on group play individual units (either echo first gen or second gen or dots) do not respond properly to questions or instructions. Failing approximately 50% of the time to even understand.  Repeated instructions to 'shut off' 'stop playing' 'off' go ignored and instructions to change volume to specific levels also go ignored.  The units appear to hear the instructions (the blue light ring), but then after a second or two go back to doing whatever they were doing.  Sometimes lowering the volume for a second or two then raising it again.  And if a specific volume number is given it will be ignored as verified by the Alexa app.It seems that the only way to control these units in a group is to use the Alexa app as voice commands seem to be ignored half of the timeI personally don't want to send the units back as they (as hardware) are okay but the software is substandard especially for Amazon.In addition a dot will not pair with an EcoXgear cube (old style or new style)SO IN CONCLUSION: a great idea poorly executed with no apparent resolve in the planning stages... surprising for Amazon.If I had known I would not have purchased another echo unit and four dots until they had worked out the bugs (something that should have been done prior to release)"
I have to reconnect to wifi inside of the app almost everyday which takes upwards of 5-10 minutes. Which completely takes away from the functionality and purpose of a hands free machine. Also does not connect well with my old Amazon Echo and has started to make it appear offline as well. Before hand there were no problems with my first generation Echo. Very disappointed in this - looking to return or wait for a software patch.
"I'm a long time owner of both the Echo Gen 1 & the Echo Dot Gen 2, and have been very happy with both. I pre-ordered the Echo Gen 2 and was excited to receive it. When I hooked it up and played some music thru it, and then told Alexa to stop, the music continued to play for a short burst. I do not have that problem with my Gen 1. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new one without a hassle. When I hooked the replacement up, the same issue was there. On Nov 3rd I contacted the Amazon Echo department, and they advised me that there was a known issue with the music on the Gen 2, and it would be fixed by Nov 6th. Well, today is Nov 8th and nothing's changed, so regrettably I am returning my second Gen 2. I might add, after reading other reviews, I agree that the quality of the sound from the Gen 2 is, at best, worse than my Gen 1. Voices are muffled and music is not crisp. Amazon's claim of improved sound was my major reason for purchasing this 2nd generation device. It was indeed a disappointment."
"The 2nd generation echo is not at all as good as the first. I will call ""Alexa"" and the light turns on and goes off immediately after, giving me no time to say anything. When she does stay on long enough for me to say something such as ""stop the music"", she ignores me or will totally misinterpret my words. I am very disappointed with the new echo, I wish they fixed the bugs before selling these."
"The echo loses connection all the time, which I am sure will be blamed on my internet no matter where I put it in a room where my wireless router is located. I have cable internet and it is fast. The setup and help section is poorly addressed and needs to be fixed. The tech was given to me as a gift if I had the choice I would have passed, I still use my computer and iPhone to access Amazon for my needs while echo sits there."
"I have 3 Echo's and each one is now unplugged. If you go to the Alexa app and choose your device ---> settings and then history you'll find a long list of recordings the echo has made while secretly listening into your home. I had no idea this was happening and I find it very creepy.  Nobody was using the wake word, etc. It just listened in and then recorded bits of conversation. I'm getting rid of them.**UPDATE** I discussed this issue with Customer Service who, by the way, have the best Rep's in the world. Their engineers reviewed my data and concluded the sounds being recorded were coming from a TV in the room. At first it was hard to agree with them but after I listened  over and over to a few of the recordings it was apparent it was from the TV.  My Bad!! I'm back to being an Echo fan. üòä"
"What a huge downgrade from the 1st generation. I can‚Äôt believe Amazon ruined something so amazing. It fails to respond constantly. The blue ring will just stay lit without a response. The sound is powerful, but not very good quality, especially on higher volumes. If you have multiple Echo‚Äôs, for some reason a more distant one in another room will often respond instead of the 2nd gen Echo just feet away. I got so sick of unplugging the 2nd gen to reboot that I stuck it in a room I barely use and use my old 1st generation Echo as the primary. I sometimes get a crackling sound when hooked to devices by Bluetooth. My connection to Sirius will drop for no reason. I will sometimes open the Alexa app and find only the 2nd gen showing as offline.No wonder they priced it much lower than the 1st gen Echo. It‚Äôs clearly an inferior, unfinished device that was rushed out to maximize holiday sales. Do yourself a favor and buy a refurbished 1st gen Echo once they are back on sale."
"This is a great product for seniors and disable individuals as the Echo can provide much needed information without the use of their hands or computer knowledge.  However, this unit was purchased for my mother-in-law where THE primary purpose was so she would be able to make outbound telephone calls to family.  She is 1) legally blind, 2) on a limited budget and 3) has a standard phone (no smartphone).  While all the product documentation exhorts all its features, it does not necessarily tell you what those features are dependent upon and to some degree what it can NOT do.  I will point out that Amazon is very explicit about the Echo NOT being able to make 911 calls. After multiple hours spent on configuration and research efforts, it became evident that this will not work for her because the Echo depends on having a smartphone to contain the telephone contact list and sharing it with the Echo device. While others in this predicament have found ways to get a 2nd (virtual) phone number, associating this with a family member's smartphone and then assigning it to the Echo, this is well beyond most average users and then presents other issues.If there is a simple way to make this work for my mother-in-law I have not found it and have given up with the Echo. We were able to configure the Google Home mini to work for her as it uses the contact list in her Gmail account. It was a lot simpler.  I am hopefully that future releases of the Echo will provide a simple means that will allow seniors to use this product without the additional and un-necessary cost of a smartphone."
"I was super excited about buying this. I got took it out of the box, and set it up with out any issues.....yet. I started trying to play my music through it, and it kept telling me my Echo was offline. The problem is that it wasn‚Äôt. So the I found the only way to resolve the issue was to put it in setup mode, and then take it out of setup mode. After doing this 4 or 5 times it would finally work, and play my music. Last night I had a different issue where I went to play music, and nothing would come through the speaker. Upon reviewing the app it said that the speaker was muted. When I tried to unmute it would not allow me, and when I put it in setup mode and back out it worked. This is extremely disappointing to me, and have already started the return process."
"The Achilles heel of Amazon‚Äôs Alexa system is having to reset the devices every day. My Charter internet service sucks and if I lose internet service for just a few seconds the 6 Amazon Alexa devices become unresponsive and have to be reset EVERY TIME, and unfortunately the only way to rest them is to unplug them, and since most of the plugs are out of reach, my only option is to unplug the wire at the device. The tiny little connection feels like it‚Äôs going to break every time I try to insert it back in the hole and I‚Äôm sure that eventually it will break.WHY ISN‚ÄôT THERE A WAY TO TELL ALEXA TO RESET THE DEVICES?!?!?! Or better yet why can‚Äôt the devices just reconnect to the internet if they loose their connection?!?!?!?!?!?!It‚Äôs the only thing that sucks about this system, but it‚Äôs a big issue, and makes me wish I‚Äôd never invested so much in these devices. Try to imagine every day when you come home from telling Alexa to turn the lights on, but instead of lights you get ‚ÄúBLONG - I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm having trouble connecting to the internet...‚Äù and since all my lights are connected to devices, controlled by Alexa, I have to unplug Alexa, wait for it to reconnect before I have lights. And then I have to walk around unplugging, and almost breaking each Alexa device.Fix this $h!+ Amazon!!!!!!!!!!"
"After returning a far more expensive HomePod from Apple because it couldn't seem to follow commands, within hearing range from their technical support team, I decided to try the Echo after I read that it could link up with some of my Apple products in an Apple Centric home. Books on how to use it are far and few between. The one I got with 1001 tips might as well be written in Urdu. Few of the tips work. So yet again, another technology product that while it may work for some doesn't work for me. I couldn't recommend it and may return it."
"The sound quality is much better than the Echo Dot I replaced with it, but the volume levels are messed up.  In order to hear what Alexa is saying you have to turn the volume WAY up.  But then when you try to listen to music it blasts you out of the room.  Customer Care was unhelpful in resolving this issue; they just completely stopped responding.Update:  Despite contacting customer care twice now, all they want to do is continuously repeat the same unsuccessful troubleshooting steps, and they don't offer to replace it.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
I got the echo for my wife the first night we had it  in our house we were using it for a while and stopped. We're sitting watching tv and all of a sudden we heard giggling. Almost like a creepy ghostly giggling we muted the tv then heard whispering and another lower laugh. It was the weirdest thing I ever experienced and am planning on returning it. I've researched online and the only way to get Alexa to laugh is to download the laughbox app. We did not even setup the Amazon account on the app nor did we download the laugh box app. So I am wondering how this happened. If anyone can answer this question or if Amazon can explain this i would really appreciate it.
"Difficult to connect. Cannot run it from my phones hotspot although that is listed as an option . The only way to connect it is by running your app on a separate device than hotspot. An unpractical solution. Having to use 2 seperate phones to run it is ridiculous.  They need to stop advertising that option since ir is not a practical solution to areas that do not have high speed internet or wifi access . I spent a long time with customer service , he was rude and impatient, and didn't seem to have very much knowledge about how exactly to do his job. My time is valuable and I am very frustrated that Amazon's employee wasted my time. I am returning this device. After making this review customer service called me within 15 minutes,  repeatedly while I was at work and finally after subsequent calls disrupting my work day,  I answered. They were trying to make my echo experience better and asked me to connect in a different way. I told them I could not talk at that time and I didn't have the device with me anyways. I could not seem to politely get him to hang up. He kept drawing the conversation out . They said that if I put the app on a separate cell phone and used my Hotspot to connect to the echo that I could then delete the app off of the other phone and continue using the echo from my personal hotspot. But when I followed their directions and then deleted the other app on someone else's phone it disconnected me and I cannot reconnect. If you would like to use Alexa off of the home Wi-Fi it works great but they should stop advertising it as hotspot compatible because it is not a practical usage. Each and every time I go in and out of range with my cell phone to the echo I have to completely reconnect it using a secondary cell phone. It takes about 15 minutes to completely hook up the echo through hotspot, so I would have to do that when I reach the edge of my yard and came back every single time. I am very dissatisfied and I feel that it was deceptive advertising. Customer service has wasted my time multiple times now with no satisfaction to the echos usage. They are not informed about the real usage of the device or how to practically help users apply the steps of connectivity.Speaker crackles and is poor quality.I am beyond frustrated with this experience and it makes me less likely to purchase any other merchandise from them in the future."
Tried two hours to set up and it keeps disconnecting and asks to set up again :(
This is the worst Alexa I have owned! Always not working and stops working.  Always having to unplug it and plug it back in. I was very excited at first to have it join our family.  What good is it if it never works. Not only that is it is very slow when it is not flashing red. Takes forever to do what you ask.
"I wish there would have been reviews before Amazon released this product,  I would not have bought this thing.  The first echo had such a rich smooth sound,  I figured this new one with IMROVED sound was going to be awesome.  I am saddened to say this new echo is nothing close to the first one.  This is about the second time I ever felt this strong about a product to ever write a review on it.  The sound is tinny and flat. If you turn the volume up even a little it gets harder to understand the song.  My husband hates it when I order from Amazon and this time he was right.  Do not order this thing,  they did not improve the sound,  they made it worse.  my husband is right this time you can't trust what you order from the internet.  It is that bad.  Thanks Amazon. I trusted you and your products and you let me down big time"
"I'm sooo disappointed. I purchased FIVE original echos, 4 dots. When I read Amazon's release & statements about the 2nd Gen Echo's ""new & improved"" dolby sound, I just HAD to buy it!! Unfortunately, I gave two of my original Echo's to friends and WISH I could ask for them back!! I love Amazon's products and am a very loyal customer, so it guts me to have to say the marketing for these new Echos was very misleading. The bass on the new Echo is no where close to the original and even the tweeters sound only (marginally) better than the Echo Dot!  Thank GOD I didn't buy the 3 pack deal on Amazon. I'm going to call customer service tomorrow at Amazon to see if I got a dud... If not, I'm taking it back to Best Buy tomorrow. I'm so sad."
"I would think most people would use this for it's music playing ability, and in this regard the Echo 2nd generation is sub par.  It is exceedingly heavy on the bass and doesn't seem to want to adjust it.  If I say ""Alexa, decrease the bass"" it doesn't recognize the command.  If I say, ""Alexa, decrease the woofer"" half the time it doesn't recognize the command and the other half it just decreases the volume.  For the life of me, I'm not sure why there isn't an equalizer menu on the Alexa App.  Maybe I have a faulty Echo, but as of right now, I consider this a horrible waste of money."
"This has been a horrible purchase from beginning to end!  If your Echo doesn't work -- like mine -- good luck getting a tech support person who can fix it, I tried 3 and they still don't work.  I invested not only a lot of money but HOURS trying to get my 3 Echos to speak to each other.  To spend so much money ON 3 DEVICES and not have the items work as they're supposed to is bad enough but that no customer service person knew how to fix it made it all the more frustrating.  Yes sometimes there's a small issue with an tech purchase and it's fixed by tech support and you move on.  NOT in this case - I spent so much time speaking to reps and reading ""help"" articles online -- what a complete waste of my time.  So much wasted time ""restarting"" the devices over & over again and reinstalling them and restarting my phone and deleting and reinstalling the app -- makes me so mad how much time I put into fixing it when in hindsight if your own techs can't figure it out there was no way any of that troubleshooting I did was ever going to work.  You lost a very good customer to Google Home and I will make sure to tell everyone I know to avoid Echo products, and every social media post I see about Echo I will respond with what a horrible product it turned out to be!  And offering me one month of free Prime for all the HOURS of hell I went through was insulting, definitely showed me how little Amazon cares about their longtime customers."
"¬†Got it from the warehouse and I see why it was returned by someone else, if 5 mins pass between the last time you addressed the unit it goes into stupid/sleep mode. It now will take three repeated questions before you get a response from the unit.it doesn`t understand the first two questions but does the third. Once awakened by the three questions it will answer questions/requests just fine until it is allowed too go idle for another 5 mins and it begins again."
"Frustrating, out of the box on initial set up the Echo seemed a dream come true.  Would play my favorite music and tell me the weather.  Then I asked a question about humming birds?  Needless to say I‚Äôm very disappointed.  Echo won‚Äôt play music anymore unless I sign up for the music unlimited.  Seems prime music no longer works? I have music in my prime library but echo can‚Äôt (or won‚Äôt) access it.  If you ask a question it answers with either ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that one‚Äù, or it just shuts down.  A total waste of money and effort."
"We received one as a gift, it was kinda cool. We mainly use it for music. I have an Amazon Prime account and it allowed me to listen to a variety of music with just that. Then without warning we would request a song that only days ago we could listen to but now we'd just get a sample. Annoying. So I upgrade to the $3.99 amazon music. That seemed to work for a while, we were able to listen to all those locked songs once again. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to order this one, a second one, so that my wife and I could listen to music in different parts of the house at the same time. WRONG.Once again the music we had been listening to was unavailable, even though I was now PAYING an ADDITIONAL subscription fee to listen to it. Try to play a song we had just listened to and only get a sample. And to add insult to injury, you can NOT listen to different music on multiple devices at the same time. That is VERY misleading in all commercials and advertisements.But it gets better! While trying to figure out what happened to the music we had been listening to, I searched it out online via the Amazon Music Player. Instead of the songs I get another advertisement that if I upgrade again to a $7.99/monthly plan I will be able to listen to all the music on all of my devices! Ok. fine. 2nd subscription upgrade. But once again, VERY misleading. You CAN NOT LISTEN TO DIFFERENT THINGS ON MULTIPLE DEVICES AT THE SAME TIME. They do not tell you that anywhere in plain sight, you have to dig to find that. Normally after you've already paid for the additional devices as well as extra subscription fees.And on top of that, not only can we only listen to a single Alexa at once, if one of us is streaming music via the Amazon Music app on our phone, or work computer, Alexa is useless.But the positive, the sound quality is decent for the size. And the music selection is decent when you can get her to understand what song you want to hear.Bottom line, one is ok but expect to pay multiple additional subscription fees on top of the price of the device. And don't even bother using your Amazon Music app at the same time.Now I have one decent little music player and one very expensive paper weight. And an ever increasing subscription fee to Amazon.I decided to order this one, a second one, so that we could listen to music in different places at the same time. Wrong. First, once the new one arrived suddenly my Prime account wasn't enough to listen to the same variety of music we had been listening to."
"Unfortunately the Echo fell short of expectations. A few flaws with this device which really make for an overall deal breaker.- Max volume is considerably lower than alternative speakers on the market. Speaker was used in a medium-size room during a party, and guests could not really hear the music being played.- Alexa recognition is faulty and often times does not respond to commands, requiring multiple attempts which become frustrating after repeated failures- Tinny audio quality.. does not sound ""full"", but instead sounds metallic and hollow.Overall, I highly recommend looking at other options. This is disappointing, and others have experienced these issues as well."
"I was totally disappointed with this item. My son has the 1st generation one and in my opinion it is way better than the 2nd generation in terms of sound and looks. The claims were that the 2nd generation would have better sound....so not true, it is half the size and in my opinion offers half the sound quality.  My husband and I did a side by side test...we played a paticuliar song on ours ( the 2nd generation) then played the song on my son's echo and his blew ours out of the water....if you are looking for style and the best sound quality,  save yourself some money and purchase the 1st generation...we sent ours back for a refund..."
"Nice compact design, good sound; however, it really is not worth buying considering that MOST questions we asked, simple things, we got standard responses like....I don't know that, or words to that effect, etc.  Also, to play any music from Amazon we either had to pay a fee each month OR join Amazon Prime (a complete disappointment).  Advertising of the product is excellent; however, actual performance leaves much to be desired.  A nice toy if you need to know what time it is and are too lazy to look at your wrist watch, or to use it as a timer, but if you want a recipe or music you better b prepared to subscribe to some PAY site(s) in order to get information/music in return.. We already sent the product back to Amazon for refund!  Unless you're an Amazon Prime member, stay away from buying this unless you don't mind paying monthly fees to enable it to perform as advertised!"
"Honestly I wish we could send it back. The first week it was an amazing tool to have the house but ever since it‚Äôs been glitchy and inconsistent. We can‚Äôt stream anything longer than 10 minutes without it stopping and shutting off. Our internet is great so that isn‚Äôt the issue. We can‚Äôt stream Pandora, Spotify, AZ sports...anything. Everything glitches. So frustrating."
"I received this as a Christmas gift and have had nothing but issues with it.  I continuously get the red ring of death and Alexa whom I have decided is the devil herself will tell me that she is having trouble understanding right now and to please come back later.  Well, she never understand and in order to fix her you have to unplug her to try again.  The problem has just gotten worse the more I try to use her.  It's been less than a month and I want to throw it against a wall.  Don't waste your hard earned money on this.  Find something better!"
"Get the Google Home. Similar price, easier to talk to, doesn't mistake everything you say for a wake word, no trouble with Amazon Music , and it actually functions instead of needing very specifically-worded commands. You need to guess at the right term about 537637 times just to add a song to your playlist - which I can't access, by the way, thanks to the horrors of Amazon Music. And the app is utter garbage. Don't buy it. Get the Google Home. I'm returning my 2nd Gen Echo for a full refund, and I will order the Google Home immediately after. Amazon's service is marvelous, though. Very sweet people.TL;DR: In contrast to the Google Home, the Echo is kind of a butt."
"I haven't been this disappointed by a purchase in a long time!  It's fine for playing songs, but even then, Alexa plays the same songs over and over.  When ask Alexa questions, she ALWAYS answers that she does not understand or does not know.  When I want to order stuff, it gives the most expensive item on Amazon (for example, spray for stains for like $16 a bottle).  This thing is a super waste of money!  I wish it wasn't past the return date."
"I got this for my husband for Christmas.  He didn‚Äôt use it.  A couple of weeks ago I moved it to a more central area in the room.  I have an Echo Dot that works grreat.  This Echo has a problem with the volume. It‚Äôs fine and then the next time I use it, the volume is too low.  Is anyone else having a volume problem with this model?I wrote a review but never heard from Amazon. This unit continues to lose volume.  Is there something I can do to correct?"
"I love my echoes,I use them primarily for home automation and listening to music.I was thrilled to hear that the 2nd generation Echo had improved sound.  Well, I guess you could say it has improved sound over the Echo Dot, let me tell you not much!.it surprises me that Amazon would be so misleading about a product description.  Typically a product should improve over time, however, this hasn't--big step back in quality of sound.On a positive note, it's size and appearance has improved but at a cost of sound quality."
"I have no idea how the Echo works as I was never able to get it to connect with my Wifi, even with the ""help"" of a Amazon tech. I received my Echo right after Ne. After being talked down to like I was a 3yr old, and telling the tech the screen he kept saying I should b e seeing wasn't appearing, he said something about my iphone, and I told him that I didn't have an iphone - I had an android. Hie next statement to me was ""Well, that's your problem!"" Evidently, android phone have a hard time connecting to Wifi...if I would have been smarter and bought an iphone we wouldn't be having this discussion. Because I didn't have a laptop or a tablet , and only had a low;y desktop with my Wifi plugged into it with a cable, the only thing I could do was keep trying to connect to my Wifi, then eventually it ""should"" work. His words...no further help - end of discussion...Good bye! Well I was patient and tried every day for 2 weeks to connect my Echo...no success. Worst experience EVER with Amazon. Today I went to Walmart and bought a Google Home, not even 10 minutes after opening it I had it connected and was enjoying music and it has worked flawlessly so far. Shame on Amazon for not letting customers know that there could be problems connecting to Wifi using android ...the tech told me this was common. Not only will I be returning my Echo, but I will not be wasting my money on an Amazon Fire either, a Rokyu set up looks better and easier to deal with."
"Purchased this product with high hopes it would help control a Fire Stick TV (which has its own problems). First downloaded the Echo app to my Samsung S8 phone. I started the application and it locked up the phone so it had to be reset. The app itself is poor and needs to be completely rewritten! Took three hours to activate the Echo. It could not ""see"" much less control the operation of the Fire Stick TV. Why do they claim it can do this?"
"Drop-ins are utter failures - drop-ins go to incorrect rooms nearly every time. Nothing pairs together, even other Amazon items like a FireTV remote, and there are no Amazonians that can support this product beyond ‚Äòreset to factory defaults and start over‚Äô. I‚Äôve had three separate chat sessions, three different email strings, and over two hours on the actual phone with ‚Äòsupport‚Äô on two different calls all to no avail. I‚Äôm usually a fan of Amazon but in this case it‚Äôs a half-finished product that they are unable to support, and they want me to get back on the phone again! Avoid it and go to Google Home - better solution all around (and it‚Äôs supported). In the meantime we‚Äôre now out half a g with a product that just plays music and reads back Wikipedia. Horrible product, pathetic support."
"After struggling and a Little Help from customer service I was able to get this thing connected. Seems to be working okay now, still a bit buggy with the voice commands. I'm hoping it gets better as time goes on. Seems to be nice enough, not really sure if I actually needed this or not. I will say that Amazon has awesome customer service, within a few minutes of posting a poor review I had gotten a phone call and emails on how to resolve the issues. This is why I love Amazon and why they crush the competition. The jury is still out on whether I needed this thing on the even like it, but once again Amazon came through with their service.I was never informed that I have to pay an extra $78 a month for the Amazon unlimited streaming to use this device properly even though I'm a Prime member. So now I have something I didn't need any way that's going to cost me extra money. I could care less about the extra money it's just the point of the matter and I'm very very unhappy with Amazon now. My recommendation is not to buy"
"Very poor audio quality. I was very much looking forward to this product and bought a few of them - they have all been returned. Sound quality is a step backwards from the original. Removal of volume ring at the top of the device is a mistake. As a customer of Amazon's since 1999, I am very surprised they would release such a poor quality product (while marketing it as a new and improved version....)"
"After having used the Echo for a few weeks now, I‚Äôve decided to sell it on eBay. I know smart assistants like this can be game changing for some people, but I‚Äôve found the Echo to be borderline useless.It mistakenly hears it‚Äôs activation word ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù multiple times a week and will randomly do things without me asking it to. Just the other day, it started the ventilation system on my car without me even mentioning ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù.I also found many of the skills that I‚Äôve setup nearly impossible to use. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just not saying the phrases correctly, but things like ‚ÄúAlexa, cool my apartment to 74‚Äù or ‚Äúset my thermostat to cool‚Äù would result in an error. I believe this has more to do with the Ecobee skill than the Echo itself, to be fair.I‚Äôve been left with using it to ask about the weather and setting timers, which I had been using my iPhone for before. For me at least, adding the Echo to my home has made things that I‚Äôve already done fairly easily with my smartphone far more cumbersome."
"Works great 50% of the time. The other half she didn‚Äôt hear you, does the wrong command, or just says she doesn‚Äôt have any video function when it‚Äôs quiet in the room."
I though this new echo was an upgrade to the first one.  The sound on this new echo is way worst than the original.  That was the main reason for me to buy this new echo. For the sound improvement. Returning all 3.
"I do not hate the echo; I hate my echo. I have ordered a total of 8 echo devices as gifts for friends and family, and they all love them, sadly enough the one I kept to myself seems never to work or is always having an issue understanding me, Since I am out of the return window, I had reached out to Amazon/Alexa support and they had me try something and they ran some test, over a spand of 2-3 weeks, the last I heard (which was about 2 weeks ago) that the tech could not find anything wrong but even the rep on the phone agreed with me that something is apparently wrong from just what he heard via over the phone when I tested the Echo with him, he said someone would get back to me, but no one has, this is after I have ordered (through amazon) the philips hue light bulbs to use in my house with the echo, but since my echo does not work I had to order extra asssoriers to link to the Hue so I can turn my lights on in my home. Overall I am disappointed in the lack of service I got with the Echo support. It does not seem like this will be ever corrected."
"Did not work or respond, wasted time item defective."
"I have a first generation Echo and the sound quality and connection is much better on the original. Additionally, I'm having a lot of connection issues grouping this new echo with my others. I have an Echo 1st Gen and 2 Echo Dots. I tried to create a group with all four to play music. The original Echo and the Dots group fine, but the Echo 2nd Gen consistently cuts out, disconnecting and reconnecting to the group randomly. I wish I would have just bought another refurbished Echo 1st Gen, since it's much better and cheaper."
"Edit: I'm returning the unit.I had a good experience with Amazon technical support and I think that some of my connection issues might be an issue with my unit.I had my wife bring home her Tap that she uses in her office. If you put the 1st Gen Echo, Tap, and 2nd Gen Echo in a line and do a sound test - in my opinion, the 2nd Gen Echo sounds about the same and possibly worse than the Tap. It doesn't sound remotely as good as the 1st Gen. I don't expect Bose or Sonos quality - but to my untrained ear this one sounds significantly worse than the 1st Gen. It's flat and distorted at high volume.Don't know how Amazon is selling this as an updated ""upgrade"" from Gen 1. And shame on Dolby for attaching its name to it.--------------------------------------I have 3 of the original Echos. Good enough sound and never had any real problems with them. Definitely a useful and enjoyable part of our home.I suppose they might fix some of the stuff through firmware or updates of some kind - but this echo is a miss. As others have pointed out, the sound quality is poor. I'm not an audiophile but I would classify it as flat. Like the sound I would get out of my cell phone speaker in a good environment.I also find there to be a slight lag in Alexa responses. This is similar to the Echo dot but I never experienced that with the last generation echo.Finally, I've also had connection problems. It can't possibly be positioning because it currently resides in the same location as a previous generation model. At random intervals, the internet connection will drop and at times it will lose connection with the network altogether. I then have to unplug and replug it back in.Super disappointing. I like the look but I think the product has gone in the wrong direction."
"Returning!! Was excited but ended up so disappointed. Will not stay connected to my wi-fi for more than 3 minutes! Tried forever, too frustrating! Not worth the aggravation. I actually was able to get it to stay connected long enough to ask it to play ONE song. It sounded good, but right at the very end, it disconnected from my wi-fi! Tried multiple locations in my house! This thing had my blood pressure up!"
"Sound quality is unfortunately worse. I was going to buy another one right before getting this one because I got obsessed with doing the whole house. The reviews are right, just not there in sound as much as the original.Pros:- Finish is cool, and nice looking than the originalCons:- After using it, the sound seems cheaper/too much trebleI just bought a refurbished generation 1 to finish the rooms."
"This is a terrible product.  I spent two days unsuccessfully trying to connect this product to my home Wi-Fi.  I then spent two hours on the phone with an Amazon service rep who tried everything he could.  When I told him I thought it was time to give up, much to my amazement, he agreed and said that Amazon has been receiving call after call from customers unable to connect the product to their home Wi-Fi.  He said that the Company is trying to rectify the problem but had no idea when if ever that might happen.  He then connected me to someone who could facilitate a return.  I wasted a lot of time but at least he was candid.  Avoid this product at all costs."
"Like the sleep sounds most and the smart home device voice activation controls. BUT this system has a loooong way to go. Often Alexa doesn't understand what I'm saying, and if your in same room while music on her is playing you have to yell ALEXA for her to hear you. Sleep sounds times out often with a loud message from Alexa waking you and our Baby up. Often requests for certain sleep sounds are suddenly unknown to Alexa or she'll play something else. Calendaring is very basic and you cannot ask, next thing or next 5 appointments on calendar. She even misses the mark on voice activations for smart devices we use often and suddenly it doesn't understand or says something went wrong. $100 down the drain! We're looking into Google."
"We have a 1st generation that works fine.The 2nd generation can't play 10 seconds of audio without cutting out. Sometimes it'll time out trying to process a question. ""Alexa, what's the weather like?"" ""It's cloud with a-"" ...10 seconds... purple light... ""Alexa, what's the weather like?"" ""It's-"" ...5 seconds... ""-cloudy with a chance of rain."" We've got a zillion other wifi devices in our home that all work fine, including a Google Home and Echo 1st gen.Fired up a support call, they told me to send it back for replacement. They said it was working fine, and returned it to me... WITHOUT A POWER CABLE. So now I can't even confirm that my defective 2nd gen Echo is still defective, which I'm pretty sure it is, assuming it's the same device."
"After extensive research and comparison between Amazon's product and Google's product, I have purchased Echo, and I regret it very much. First of all, Alaxa doesn't support many (most) other languages than English, which is not the case with Google Dot. The physical volume button of my Alexa don't even work. Sound quality is also below my expectation. Overall, I would not recommend Amazon's voice service over Google's."
Alexa started out great. Now when I ask it to tell me the news I get ads for online gaming. If I wanted that then I would search for it. I have not been able to get it to stop. Quite annoying. Almost to the point of returning Alexa.
"I received the Alexa Echo 2nd Generation as a gift for Christmas.  My wife and I have many ""techy"" products in our home and enjoy what we are able to do with them.  We are an ""Apple"" household, 2 iPhones, 2 iPads, 1 Apple Watch and a Mac Air!  After having this Echo in our home for the past 4 months I find it to be completely worthless to use with our Apple products.  To use My Media to connect to my Music Library requires me to connect my Apple product via Bluetooth before I can play music on the Echo.  It is as easy for me to connect my Bose bluetooth speaker to preform the same function.  This unit is a waste of space in our home as Alexa is not meant to be a companion to Apple products.  (Only Amazon) and I Love my Apple products and I'm not about to switch!  For those who have Apple products I would advise you to purchase a product that is user friendly!"
"i got an echo dot for Christmas and loved it, I bought this, another Dot and the telephone echo to work with my Ooma. When I went to connect it was not the same experience as the Dot I got for Christmas. After a few hours I gave up trying to get it to work. It maybe hit or miss with Echo. I will wait until they improve. The idea is great but frustrating."
"Piece of crap doesn't work at all. It won't recognize my phone or email login, and an hour on the phone with an ""expert"" didn't help at all. I'll try another brand. I wonder if anyone ever got it to work?"
Junk Junk Junk! This unit will no work with a MacBook Pro! Can you imagine that! It also will not set up with Amazon Prime account if you want to attach another phone number account! These people need to really go into COMMON SENSE mode.... right out of the box it is pure 100% garbage.... Really Shame on you!!!?
"My first generation Echo works perfectly! I bought this one for the kitchen (and moved the 1st gen to MBA)--put it in the same exact location--but now I have to stand over it and yell out instructions to get it to work!! Also, I will be playing ""my"" music library, or just a random station, and it just shuts off automatically after 15-20 minutes...no instructions, no power outage...just shuts off.  IDK if I got a lemon or what, but it's going back! Not a 2nd generation fan. :-/"
"We have a 1st generation Echo, which sounds very good.  Our new 2nd generation Echo was just delivered.  After setting it up, we quickly realized that the sound was muffled and of noticeably lesser quality than the 1st generation version.  The sound lacks definition.  It's as if the ""treble"" level is turned all the way down.  There are no clear highs and the mid-range isn't that much better.  Also, recent reviews refer to a firmware update that supposedly improves the sound.  Our new Echo updated on its own (though I don't know to what version) but it doesn't sound any better.  I think this one's going back."
"Just another way to  milk money out of customers. Sound is great but only plays songs if you subscribe to the service! ( and pay a monthly fee) For most questions you ask you get ""I don't know that"" . I guess its better than a dog ,but not much! Once you establish a conversation with another person the dialog flows without a personal address . With alexa it requires that you continually preface with ""alexa""......for it to respond.  I received this one as a gift. Would I buy one for $5.00 .  NO!  Just read an article that indicated that the unit may mess up your internet router and we have been having computer problems since we plugged it in. We are on DSL frontier and normally have some problems so not sure on that . If get the courage to unplug it  and plug it back in to test that out I will let you know . (am fearful of having to go through the set up process again!) I gave it 1 star  for its good morning greeting!!!"
"Alexa doesn't work well with our sonos system at all. She randomly starts talking when we don't want her to and often can't answer or respond to commands when we want her to. I'm consistently more impressed with Siri's ability to interpret or have fun easter eggs embedded for commands it doesn't understand. We enjoy confusing our dog by making her bark, and our son likes to ask her to make fart noises, but otherwise we find her to be largely useless and more annoying that helpful."
Horrible!  Every time I ask Alexa to play music it plays songs  with totally explicit lyrics and it is not only offensive to myself and my children but embarrassing when guests are at the house.  No matter how I try to repharase her playing music without explicit lyrics she either says I don‚Äôt understand or.....so you want me to play explicit music?  I end up cursing at the stupid thing worse then the lyrics!  So annoying and stressful!
"This item has been malfunctioning for three weeks now. Technical support is a joke.  I just want one that works !!!  Eight phone calls later, all I am is pissed.  How hard is it to swap it out and test it ‚Äúin-house‚Äù ?"
